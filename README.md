It is my last project held by MULTICAMPUS...

And, I've met the worst team member ever  and ever...

They only create 2 models but cannot handle how to use post and get.

The more I tried, I feel frustrated since they do not work and only give me uncompleted codes and asked me how to amend them. 

So, for the better project, I had to push them to work and create new code but actually i only gave them pre-completed codes... The only thing they have to do were just add one line of code....
